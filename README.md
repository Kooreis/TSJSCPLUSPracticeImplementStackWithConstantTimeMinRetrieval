# Question: How would you implement a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided implements a stack data structure that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time. The solution uses two stacks: one for storing all elements and another for storing the minimum elements. When a new element is pushed onto the main stack, it is also pushed onto the minimum stack if it is less than or equal to the current minimum value. When an element is popped from the main stack, it is also popped from the minimum stack if it is the current minimum value. This ensures that the top element of the minimum stack is always the smallest element in the main stack. The top method returns the top element of the main stack, while the getMin method returns the top element of the minimum stack, allowing for constant time retrieval of the minimum element.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. The logic and methods used to solve the problem are the same. The main difference is that TypeScript includes type annotations, which provide a way to enforce that certain values are of certain types.

In the TypeScript version, the `stack` and `minStack` are explicitly declared as arrays of numbers (`number[]`). The `push` method is annotated to accept a number parameter (`x: number`), and the `top` and `getMin` methods are annotated to return a number. The `pop` method in TypeScript version does not return anything (`void`), unlike in the JavaScript version where it returns the removed element.

These type annotations help to catch errors during development, before the code is run. They make the code more self-documenting and provide better tooling (like autocompletion and inline documentation in IDEs).

Another minor difference is that the TypeScript version uses `let` to declare `minStack`, while the JavaScript version uses `const`. This doesn't change the behavior of the code, as `minStack` is not reassigned in either version. It's generally recommended to use `const` where possible, to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same logic as the JavaScript version. Both versions use two stacks: one to store all the elements and another to store the minimum elements. The `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin` methods work in the same way in both versions.

However, there are some differences due to the different features and syntax of the two languages:

1. In C++, the `stack` is a built-in data structure in the Standard Template Library (STL), while in JavaScript, an array is used to simulate a stack.

2. In C++, the `push`, `pop`, and `top` methods are built-in methods of the `stack` class, while in JavaScript, these operations are performed using the `push`, `pop`, and array indexing (`[]`) operations.

3. In C++, the `empty` method is used to check if a stack is empty, while in JavaScript, the `length` property of an array is used.

4. In C++, the `cout` statement is used for output, while in JavaScript, the `console.log` function is used.

5. In C++, the `MinStack` class does not have a constructor like in JavaScript. The `stack` and `minStack` are declared and initialized when they are defined.

6. In C++, the `MinStack` methods are declared as `public` to allow access from outside the class. In JavaScript, all methods are public by default.

7. In C++, the `main` function is used to test the `MinStack` class, while in JavaScript, the testing code is not enclosed in a function.
